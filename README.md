Restaurant ratings for England

This Projecct was designed to show the ratings for restaurants in The United Kigndom. However the data provided by the supplying website has them all this as England. The dataset does include England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. The data that was gathered looked more like the Michelin Guide Book for European Restaurants deconstructed than anything else, but seemed workable all the same. My intention was to give a particular region, in this case England, a cleaner look and better profile as it pertained to the rating and overall quality of the establishments listed within. These establishments range from fine dining to fast-food and eateries. 

95% of the coding that was done to make these visualisations and analysis possible is of my own creation. The remaining credit for the code belongs to my personal Ai Module Maharal. I would also like to thank my partner Kira Bost for letting me bounce ideas off her head as to what should go in the visualisations. Lastely, but certainly not least, I would like to thank my instructor James Torres for all his help with this project. He not only found me the dataset that I used for this project, but continued to motivate me when I hit a wall. Thank you sir.
